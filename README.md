# Domain.com.au Property Listing Scraper

## Overview
This sub-project aims to provide a robust listing source from Domain.com.au, specifically for the Melbourne area, to support my side project (for learning purposes). The data fields included in the tool are:

- Price
- Property Type: House, Townhouse, Apartment / Unit / Flat, House & Land
- Features: Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Parking spaces, and Land size (in mÂ²)
- Additional Feature List: e.g., Air conditioning, Ensuite, Built-in wardrobes, Secure Parking, Rainwater storage tank
- Property Description

The scraper's base URL is based on filtering the features mentioned (excluding land type) and targets properties in the Melbourne area. You can check out areas of interest by modifying the base URL at the start of the program.

## How to Use
This application uses `selenium` to interact with "Read More" buttons to collect data. Ensure all necessary packages are installed from `requirements.txt` and that [`ChromeDriver`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/get-started) is correctly set up.
